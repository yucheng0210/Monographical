New Amplify shader with custom wind and multiple features.

  - Grass Foliage shader 

       (Custom Amplify shader for grass): Physically-based lighting with translucency, simple wind, includes color variation, vertex Ao, and distance depth fade, supports mesh with custom normals. Wind and other parameters can be controlled globally through the (upcoming) wind script.

  - Tree bark and leaf shader

       (Custom Amplify shader for trees): Physically-based lighting with translucency, simple branch bending, wind, and leaf fluttering, supports trees with custom normals on leaves, includes color variation and vertex Ao. Wind and other parameters can be controlled globally through the (upcoming) wind script.

(At the moment the wind is controlled directly through the shader so you will have to match both values of the bark and leaves together.)

Contains new (TFS) demo scene for UPR and HDRP
