1. Custom Amplify shaders

Feel free to edit and use these in the Amplify shader editor, ready for use in your projects!

2. WavingDoublePassEdit_Shader

Slightly edited Terrain grass shader. Works the same way as the old one. The wind is controlled through the terrain "bending slider", "speed" and "size" do nothing. Improved shading, PBR lit, works with reflection probes, softer looking shading, improved wind. (4 textures recommended otherwise the wind will not work properly but you can use as many textures as you wish.)

***This shader no longer works in SRP since it cannot be directly overwritten anymore. You are free to try but there's a chance it won't work in build.
