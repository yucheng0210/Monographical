1. CTI Terrain Tree Prefab Folder. 

Every tree from the Main CTI prefab folder should work right off the bat with wind and the terrain engine. The only problem is that the "terrain trees don't work with mesh colliders", "only capsule colliders work". Use the trees in this folder if you want to use them with the terrain engine instead.

2. While tree creator like trees usually render very fast, LOD trees suffer from the same issue SpeedTrees do: In case you have a lot of them the performance may drop unless you use other 3rd party solutions like Critias Foliage or Vegetation Studio. I would recommend turning off the speedtree crossfading for better performance!
