1. RHESecene_UnityTerrain_Fall - Medium map
2. RHESecene_UnityTerrain_Summer - Big map (Might take a while to load depending on your machine)
3. RHESecene_UnityTerrain_Winter - Small map

Notice*

These scenes were made for URP but still work in HDRP. Since HDRP terrain only supports 8 tiles at this time and the old one had more than 12, you might have to delete some of them to fix the terrain holes. I also left the terrain grass details ON, since maybe one day Unity will have it working in HDRP again.
